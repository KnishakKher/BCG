    <h2>ARMS WORKOUT</h2>
     <div>
      <b>1:Chin ups</b><br>
      <p>Chin-ups are performed by gripping a bar with your palms facing toward you (underhand grip) about shoulder-width apart, hanging with arms fully extended, then pulling your body upward until your chin is above the bar, and lowering yourself back down slowly. They mainly target the biceps and upper back muscles, particularly the latissimus dorsi, along with the shoulders and core for stability. The benefits include increasing bicep size and strength, improving back definition, enhancing upper body pulling ability, and supporting better posture and grip endurance.</p><br>

      <b>2:Dips</b><br>
      <p>Dips are performed by holding onto parallel bars or the edges of a sturdy surface with your arms straight and body suspended, then slowly lowering yourself by bending your elbows until your upper arms are about parallel to the ground, followed by pushing back up to the starting position. They mainly target the triceps, chest, and front shoulders, while also engaging the core for balance. The benefits include developing strong and defined triceps, improving pushing strength for other exercises like push-ups or bench presses, and enhancing upper body muscle coordination and endurance.</p><br>
