    <div><i>Welcome to the one stop guide for <b>CALISTHENICS</b></i><br><br>
    Before starting , lets know what calisthenics actually is and what are its advantages over regular workouts at a gym and where does it falls behind....
<p><h3>What is Calisthenics ?</h3>
Any bodyweight workout we do falls under the category of calisthenics like push-ups , squats , pull-ups etc. Calisthenics involves any bodyweight movement we do to make our body more stronger , athletic and flexible.

<h3>Advantages of calisthenics over a Gym :</h3>
The main advantage of calisthenics over a Gym is that your body itself is the Gym. Where people make excuses to go to the Gym just because they don't feel like working-out and feel lazy , calisthenics instantly kills all such excuses as all you need for most of these workouts is your body and gravity.
<br>
Lets be honest , not everyone's goal is to become a body-builder, most of us just want to stay fit and athletic in our day to day life leading to a healthy life , yet a lot of such people join Gyms and just pay the membership fees for what they can literally achieve for free at home.
Machines in the gym are specifically designed for body-building and each machine targets a specific muscle but in calisthenics our whole body works as a whole single unit , thus practically helping us in our day to day movements and activities.<br>
<h3>Disadvantages of Calisthenics : 
</h3>
Even though calisthenics can make us strong but that's not true for things beyond our body-weight , doing a 100 push-ups won't make us strong enough to bench press crazy weights and that can only be achieved either by traditional weight lifting and Gym exercises , though we can add weight to our calisthenics movements using a weighted vest or other such external weights but that brings out of the calisthenics catagory and puts us in the weighted or hybrid calisthenics category but since this is a website for calisthenics , we will just stick to calisthenics only. <br>
Our legs are already strong and our body-weight alone can't make them a lot more stronger than they already are , and while it's true that calisthenics will make you bigger , nut that's only for the upper body and not for our legs , because all calisthenics can give u are some over puffed chicken legs and not what someone will consider a muscular leg.   </p></div> <br>
