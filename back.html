     <h2>BACK WORKOUT</h2>
     <div>
      <b>1:Pull ups</b><br>
      <p>Pull-ups are done by gripping a bar with your palms facing away from you at shoulder-width or slightly wider, hanging with arms fully extended, then pulling your body upward until your chin passes the bar, and lowering yourself back down under control. They primarily target the back muscles (latissimus dorsi), biceps, shoulders, and forearms, while also engaging the core for stability. The benefits include building a strong and wide back, improving grip strength, enhancing upper body pulling power, and promoting better posture by strengthening the posterior chain.</p><br>

      <b>2:Australian pull ups</b><br>
      <p>Australian pull-ups using a straight bar are performed by positioning a low horizontal bar around waist height, gripping it with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, keeping your body straight with heels on the ground and arms fully extended, then pulling your chest toward the bar while maintaining a rigid body line, and lowering yourself back down slowly. They primarily target the upper and middle back muscles, including the lats, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, as well as the biceps and core for stabilization. The benefits include strengthening the pulling muscles, improving posture, developing grip endurance, and providing a controlled way to build the foundation for full pull-ups.</p><br>

      <b>3:Inverted Rows</b><br>
      <p>Inverted rows are performed by lying under parallel bars or gym rings, gripping them with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width, keeping your body straight from head to heels, and pulling your chest toward the bars or rings until they touch or nearly touch your chest, then lowering yourself back down in a controlled manner. They primarily target the upper back muscles, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, while also engaging the biceps, forearms, and core. The benefits include improving back and arm strength, enhancing posture, developing pulling power for more advanced exercises like pull-ups, and balancing upper body muscle development.</p><br>

      <b>4:Chin ups</b><br>
      <p>Chin-ups are performed by gripping a bar with your palms facing toward you (underhand grip) about shoulder-width apart, hanging with arms fully extended, then pulling your body upward until your chin is above the bar, and lowering yourself back down slowly. They mainly target the biceps and upper back muscles, particularly the latissimus dorsi, along with the shoulders and core for stability. The benefits include increasing bicep size and strength, improving back definition, enhancing upper body pulling ability, and supporting better posture and grip endurance.</p><br>

      <b>5:Superman hold</b><br>
      <p>The superman hold is performed by lying face down on the floor with your arms extended straight in front of you, then simultaneously lifting your arms, chest, and legs off the ground while keeping your neck neutral and holding the position for a few seconds. It primarily targets the lower back (erector spinae), glutes, hamstrings, and shoulders, helping to strengthen the posterior chain. The benefits include improving lower back stability, enhancing posture, reducing the risk of back pain, and balancing core strength by working the muscles opposite to the abdominals.</p><br>
